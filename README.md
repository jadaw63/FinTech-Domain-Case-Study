# FinTech-Domain-Case-Study
CASE STUDY WITHIN THE FINTECH DOMAIN
## Overview and Origin
* Name of company <br>
 Power Ledger. 
* When was the company incorporated?<br>
Incorporated in May 2016.

* Who are the founders of the company?<br>
Jemma Green, David Martin, and John Bulich.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?<br>
The founders thought about how owners of solar panels could not share extra solar energy that is generated or buy needed energy from their neighbors [1].
 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?<br>
The company was funded by private investors such as top two Bill Tai and Fundamental Labs, approximately $35M USD over 3 rounds, the last round was a grant round. The company has a total of five investors [2].
## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?<br>
Power Ledger intends to develop a peer-to-peer marketplace to trade and track Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). One REC equals 1MW of renewable energy generated. Blockchain tools were developed by Power Ledger to support a secure and efficient trading within the renewable energy credit marketplace [3].
 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?<br>
The intended customer is either an individual, business, community group or a school. The producer of this energy could be a commercial property, apartment home, or an individual with a rooftop solar panel system installed [1]. 
 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)<br>
Individual solar power generators can set their own price of energy and donate the energy to community groups and schools[1]. Virtual Power Plant (VPP), this is a virtual network of batteries   that allows the 'prosumer' or the production consumer to store their excess solar energy [4]. A prosumer is a consumer that also produces or store electricity for their needs [5]. The prosumer sells the poruced energy to the energy grid during peak demand, the prices are higher so the prosumer benefits, the total annual energy costs will be lower is using a VPP [6].
 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)<br>
They are using the Power Ledger Platform for energy trading and the Power Ledger Token (POWR)<sup>TM</sup>. POWR is based on the energy trading token Sparkz [5]. Power Ledger supports internal applications, the most relevant application for this study is TraceX. TraceX is the specific marketplace platform for trading "environmental commodities such as RECs and carbon credits" [7].
## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?<br>
Blockchain and crypto currency.
 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?<br>
 Smart contracts (decentralized applications (Dapps)) built on blockchain, might be able to auto sell and buy based on price indicators [8]. Technology companies in the U.S have invested millions of dollars in blockchain initiatives over the past two years, with plans to continue investment in the next 12 months [9].

* What are the other major companies in this domain?<br>
LO3 Energy, SP Group, and Electron.
## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?<br>
Using blockchain will ensure more transparent transactions so that the RECs are not bought and sold again. Power Ledger’s projects are worldwide, as of August 26th, 2020, they have more than 20 projects in 10 countries, including the United States, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Australia, across 4 continents [10].

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?<br>
Power Ledger has a larger customer base and partner list than most of its competitors, for example competitor LO3 Energy serves less than 270,000 people in the state of Vermont [11], whereas Power Ledger has 20 projects in 10 countries as stated earlier [10].
## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)<br>
I would advise this company not to lose sight of their company mission and scope. Power Ledger company has grown rapidly in four years, not just in size but in the volume of work. Companies that rapidly expand seem to maintain a higher risk. Power Ledger also conducts business with government power programs which could be a risk while working with multiple nations. As an example, certain nations may refuse to do business with them due to their current clients and/or partners. Rapid growth is not always a positive measure of success for organizations.
